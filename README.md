# AnyIpsum

![Screenshot of AnyIpsum in action](screenshot.png)

OS X status bar application that lets you select a
[lorem ipsum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorem_ipsum) variation and copy it
to the pasteboard.

Please fork and improve. This was done as a learning experience with Swift.

## Usage

Ipsum variations are stored in `Ipsum.plist`, and will be read upon application
launch. Future improvements might include randomized paragraphs or sentences
made up from a set of words.
